# Logo Setup Instructions

## Save Your Logo Image

1. Save your logo image (the rounded square with gradient stripes) to:
   ```
   public/logo.png
   ```

2. The image should be:
   - PNG format with transparency
   - Square dimensions (recommended: 512x512px or 1024x1024px)
   - The rounded square design with gradient stripes

## Alternative Formats

If you prefer a different format, you can use:
- `public/logo.svg` - For vector graphics (best quality)
- `public/logo.webp` - For smaller file size
- `public/logo.png` - For standard compatibility

## Already Done

✅ The Navbar component has been updated to use the logo
✅ The public directory has been created
✅ Fallback gradient background is included if image fails to load

## Next Steps

1. Place your logo file in the `public/` directory
2. If using a different format, update the path in `src/components/Navbar.tsx` (line ~92)
3. Refresh your browser to see the logo

**Note**: The Navbar will show a gradient background until you add the actual logo file.
