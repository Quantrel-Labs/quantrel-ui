# üé® Adding Your Logo to the Navbar

## Quick Setup

Your Navbar has been updated to display the logo image! Here's what you need to do:

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
Place your logo image (the rounded square with gradient stripes) in the `public` folder:

```
react-tailwind-shadcn-starter/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.png  ‚Üê Save your logo here
```

### Step 2: Supported Formats
The component currently looks for `logo.png`, but you can use:
- **PNG** - `logo.png` (recommended for images with transparency)
- **SVG** - `logo.svg` (best for scalable graphics)
- **WebP** - `logo.webp` (smaller file size)
- **JPG** - `logo.jpg` (if no transparency needed)

If you use a different format, update line 92 in `src/components/Navbar.tsx`:
```tsx
<img src="/logo.svg" alt="Quantrel Logo" />
```

### Step 3: Verify
1. Save your logo file to `public/logo.png`
2. Your dev server should auto-refresh
3. The logo will appear in the navbar!

### Fallback Behavior
If the image isn't found or fails to load, the navbar will automatically show:
- A gradient background (blue ‚Üí purple ‚Üí pink)
- The letter "Q" as a fallback

## Current Implementation

The logo is now:
- **Size**: 40x40px (responsive)
- **Shape**: Rounded corners (border-radius: 12px)
- **Position**: Left side of navbar, next to "Quantrel" text
- **Hover**: Smooth opacity transition
- **Responsive**: Shows on all screen sizes

## Example Logo Specs

For best results, your logo should be:
- **Dimensions**: Square (512x512px or 1024x1024px recommended)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Style**: The rounded square with gradient stripes design
- **File size**: Under 100KB for optimal loading

## Testing

After adding the logo:
1. Check desktop view - logo + text
2. Check mobile view - logo + text (text hidden on smallest screens)
3. Check hover effect - slight opacity change
4. Check dark mode - logo should work on dark background
