# Logo Integration Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created Public Directory
- Created `public/` folder in your project root
- This is where static assets like logos are stored in Vite projects

### 2. Updated Navbar Component
**File**: `src/components/Navbar.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Replaced the gradient `<span>` with letter "Q" with an `<img>` tag
- Added logo container with proper styling (40x40px, rounded corners)
- Implemented fallback system: if image fails to load, shows gradient + "Q"
- Maintained responsive behavior and hover effects

**Before**:
```tsx
<span className="inline-flex h-10 w-10 items-center justify-center rounded-xl bg-gradient-primary text-base font-bold">Q</span>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<div className="relative h-10 w-10 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-gradient-primary flex-shrink-0">
  <img 
    src="/logo.png" 
    alt="Quantrel Logo" 
    className="h-full w-full object-cover"
    onError={(e) => {
      // Fallback to gradient with Q if image fails to load
      e.currentTarget.style.display = 'none'
      const parent = e.currentTarget.parentElement
      if (parent) {
        parent.innerHTML = '<span class="flex items-center justify-center h-full w-full text-base font-bold text-white">Q</span>'
      }
    }}
  />
</div>
```

### 3. Created Documentation
- **LOGO_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Step-by-step guide for adding your logo
- **public/LOGO_SETUP.md** - Quick reference in the public folder

## 📋 What You Need To Do

### Save Your Logo Image

**Option 1: Save as PNG (Recommended)**
1. Save the attached rounded square logo image as: `public/logo.png`
2. Make sure it's a square image (preferably 512x512px or larger)
3. PNG format with transparency works best

**Option 2: Use a different format**
1. Save as `public/logo.svg` (for vector graphics)
2. Or `public/logo.webp` (for smaller file size)
3. Update the image source in Navbar.tsx if needed

### Recommended Image Specs
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: 512x512px or 1024x1024px (square)
- **File size**: Under 100KB
- **Content**: The rounded square with gradient stripes design

## 🎯 How It Works

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Logo (40x40px) + "Quantrel" text
- **Mobile**: Logo (40x40px) + "Quantrel" text (text hides on extra small screens)
- **All sizes**: Smooth hover effect (opacity change)

### Styling
- **Shape**: Rounded corners (12px border radius)
- **Background**: Gradient (blue → purple → pink) as fallback
- **Size**: 40x40px fixed size
- **Object-fit**: Cover (maintains aspect ratio)

### Fallback System
If the logo image fails to load:
1. Image is hidden
2. Container shows gradient background
3. Letter "Q" appears centered
4. No layout shift or broken image icon

## ✨ Features

✅ **Smart Fallback** - Shows gradient + "Q" if image fails

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Save your logo** to `public/logo.png`
2. **Refresh your browser** - Vite will auto-reload
3. **See your logo** in the navbar!

If the image doesn't appear:
- Check the file path: `public/logo.png`
- Check the file name (case-sensitive)
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify the image file isn't corrupted

---

## 📸 Expected Result

After adding the logo, your navbar will show:
- Your custom rounded square logo (with gradient stripes)
- Next to the "Quantrel" text
- On a dark background with glass morphism effect
- With smooth hover interaction

The logo will be clearly visible and professional-looking, matching the Framer-inspired aesthetic of your design system.

**That's it! The code is ready - just add your logo file.** 🎨
